The church is one of several safehouses in the Reading area alone that, on six of the seven nights of the week gives itself up for the recovery of addicts, the seventh being the Holy Day in which the church, St. Luke\u2019s very own, holds an all-day mass, of whom many of us seated here today typically attend. In fact, when I first arrived here there was some sort of crackpot conspiracy going around in the Reading TA circles that the church was recruiting former addicts in a last-ditch attempt to arouse support in the face of increasing atheism, or rather, apathism. I didn't really believe the theories and regardless the rumours eventually died as people lost interest despite a 2-year stint in the national newspapers, but who knows, I was converted a Christian after attending St. Luke\u2019s every day for a period of 10 weeks and here I remain, on my way to becoming devout, as are the majority of us. I should note here quickly, that I am perfectly happy as a Christian and would not resent anyone for deceiving me into becoming one. Although actually, on further reflection this theory has some traction since the Church has long been anti-technology since Earth began rotating and even then, those allegations arose once more in contemporary times, despite trying to shake off that anti-tech image, when the Pope\u2019s Instagram account was closed following considerable mickey-taking lodged at a PR-posted picture of Pope Gianluigi lying on his bed with arms around the necks of 2 young boys and, even if it was completely innocent, the whole ordeal was probably enough to suggest that the Church is completely out-of-touch in post-post Earth rotation time, but so it still needs people to collect donations from to keep it's head above the water (so it was thought within a sect of researchers for a period of two or so years that the Earth had stopped rotating, or rather it had never started as it was fixed and that the Sun was the one doing the rotating once again, which got debunked well within a day of news circulating, the original news itself attributed to human error, but so in a frugal effort to save face, these researchers, only the Divine Power knows how they were funded all this time, kept running tests and kept intentionally distorting the numbers to the point where they started believing their own edits to not actually be their own, rather that God was working through them, and so this finally comes to a head when a lowly archetypal genius janitor gets wind of the original and altered figures and puts two and two together, going public with the story, effectively rendering said researchers out of employment and into the welcoming arms of the Church). So it could well be true but a few of us here are more concerned by the increasing sponsorship of groups such as in the case of American lager brand Coors attaching their name to EMA.

In any case those annual UNF-triple-C meetings and the IPCC was a total waste of time as climate change was proved a hoax and no sea level changes were recorded, therefore no flooding of seawater occurred and no cities were submerged. Instead cities were flooded by the endorphins secreted by the pituitary glands of, like, 6 billion people.

They even legalised some of the more classier (in grading terms) narcotics considering that at this point the majority of the population couldn't even drag themselves away to meet with a dealer, and that franchises were as a result closing left, right and centre leaving only the most hardened, seasoned and paranoid-free to deliver direct-to-door, even beyond simply letting stoners run wild, though the whole process was still tightly controlled, so that the state could open up a new, rather safe revenue stream and, with respect to the fact that not five years earlier the cases of valium addiction and dark web-disseminated legal high use in minors had reached an all-time high, as well as more general skyrocketing methamphetamine sales, this entire initiative was seen as a rousing success on the part of the D.N.A..\n    "])),(l()(),U._17(null,["\n\n    "])),(l()(),U._4(0,null,null,1,"p",[],null,null,null,null,null)),(l()(),U._17(null,["\n        That aforementioned job mechanisation really got going when some bright spark in the WAIRO (Worldwide Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Organisation) thought it would be a good idea to let AI progress beyond the human threshold set forth two years prior at the fourteenth annual global conference for alarming matters pertaining to the human race (codenamed Clarke.14 in inner circles). This shows just how little power the guys at the top have these days when some lowly tech guy can determine humanity\u2019s fate. In any case this guy took one of three options presented to him: stagnation, some form of equilibrium between humanity and AI, or else to let loose a competitive spirit lost within us. In truth, his decision-making was probably resultant of a little (or a lot of) boredom as well. And so these AI have kept progressing and are now at human intelligence quotient ceiling + 20 (i.e. singularity, plus 20), showing only limited signs of declining. The thing is there is now no way to stop this trend of AI improvement and so we just have to kind of roll with it. The blame rests solely on that one tech guy who watched 2001: A Space Odyssey one too many times and actually thought, well, our intelligence has arguably reached this point of stagnation (there are too many factors said to have had an influence on this to list them all) according to a few influential articles in the 34th edition, 2nd issue of the International Journal of Human Progress, and so by increasing AI we increase competition and strive towards some kind of new human race. This reasoning appeared logical to the judge when nations of the world started suing this individual for their slower rates of GDP and this actually led to an ethical trial when it was decided that this one action went far beyond financial interests and there was at one particular point actually a chance that the death penalty could be reinstated solely for this one guy and maybe subsequently dropped again (a big maybe). Anyway, the judge spared him on the basis that he hadn't actually killed anyone yet though it\u2019s said that he still receives daily death threats in prison (he was locked away by a different judge when it became clear that he would be unable to pay the vast sums he was sued for). Still, in my mind there remains the semblance of hope, in an ethical sense, for the current human race, if not certainly the next human race, considering the Sony Corporation v. International Court of Justice [2034] case where Sony appealed against the decision to disallow the introduction of unconscious micro-payments in people\u2019s D.R.s (Dream Replacements, a rapidly expanding field within dream tech, that is, it was reasoned, the concept itself is arguably fair game and not-at-all-decietful (until people forming part of the initial take-up started waking up and checking their bank balances to see that there was nothing left) - and were actually ordered to pay for the returning of said balances, plus an added extra for even thinking of charging people in what was once their dreams, which are not so much dreams anymore as they are a selection of carefully curated YouTube videos, or Twitch.tv virtual reality livestreams of people in their VR rooms, or BBC (no longer public by the way) 24 hour news services, of which people are able to purchase in packages and even set which is to be played when. This allows synchronisation with sleep cycle monitors for the most optimal of rests, because really, what else is there to do? Personally I was always fond of the the good, old-fashioned Traditional Sports Package when I was O.U.T.S.I.D.E., which I set to show soothing highlights of my favourite players in the first stage before getting into greatest upsets and touchline bust-ups during deeper sleep, but with every passing day I\u2019m becoming more and more accustomed to my own philosophising before bed, natural dreaming during sleep and post-sleep wallowing (the wallowing being nothing new, all things considered).

Prior to David Bowie\u2019s death he was your fairly standard narcotics expert, in this case referring to his role in the government (though not officially a civil servant) as a drugs analyst but he also (unlike his colleagues) really enjoyed using drugs on the side, sometimes even as a main during work. Alongside this aspect of his character, he harked back to the 80s a lot and was mad for like 30 years that Bowie had killed off Major Tom. Attempts made by others to continue the Major Tom legacy were never satisfactory. After nationalisation he resented the government\u2019s limiting of potency as a means to a safer future and eventually realised that within a year his job would be lost to AI. So he decided he would go out with a what is usually seen as a proverbial bang, however, in this case it happened to be far more literal. Growing more and more experimental with his consumption and production, including a stint of actually dressing up as an astronaut to work which lasted only until he saw Bowie\u2019s Blackstar video depicting Major Tom as dead, he worked hard in his final days as an analyst, at that point facing sobriety head-on, which probably explains most of his abnormal actions and general experimentality, he sought to create the drug to end all drugs. And he did, sort of. He created what he saw as the perfect drug, capable of inducing no comedown. Says he modelled it after The Matrix's redpill. Like, they say acid changes your perspective, but this prototype drug, codenamed Major, actually changed your life forever. Irreversibly so; it never ended. Anyway the Department of Narcotics and Alcohol eventually caught onto him and seized everything but by that point he\u2019d already a.) taken the drug, and b.) distributed it to friends. The Mechanic, not being at-all happy with this, comes into work one last day for questioning, answers them as politely as he can given the circumstances, just prior to blowing his lab to smithereens with a homemade bomb made together with the Electrician. They work well as a team, the Sarge had to give them that. And so, even though Major Tom is dead (allegedly he says, even in light of pretty conclusive evidence), he decides to resurrect him as, well, himself. He takes over the persona of Major Tom, or rather, his persona takes over Major Tom, but he genuinely thinks he is this fictional character even though nobody ever believes him or even calls him by that name and Michael's pretty sure that Codename Major had some say in his decision-making. So given his past he decides to get into technology in a pretty big way, learning the ins and outs of gadgets so that he can fix them, at a price of course. And of course he uses, in a big way. He has resolve, this Major Tom does, that\u2019s to his credit. While the rest of his friends blew their brains out after facing the reality of always being high on Major, the Mechanic just went with the flow.

She had no energy to go through again what had she had put up with for so long. She lived mostly as a husk. The kid, though, was resolute, tried to give life back to her mother but she was too far gone by the time the kid started getting sentimental and tried dishing out life lessons at the tender age of 12. Around that time the father started getting desperate, the benefits running dry, started raiding her piggy bank for loose change that she\u2019d earned helping out neighbours and even the gated community about a 15 minute walk east of their hellhole.
